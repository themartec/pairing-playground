# Pairing playground

[![Tests](https://github.com/themartec/pairing-playground/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/themartec/pairing-playground/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## TL;DR

```sh
git clone git@github.com:themartec/pairing-playground.git
cd pairing-playground

nvm use
make                # show usage instructions
make full-build     # run full build including E2E tests
```

NOTE: extra installation help that would be required for above

```sh
# you may need to install correct version of node
nvm install             # assuming you have nvm installed

# you may need to install playwright
npx playwright install
```
